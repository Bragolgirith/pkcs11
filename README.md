# Java PKCS11 Library

## Introduction

This project provides a pure Java based library to access a native PKCS11 library. It requires Java 21+ and is based on
the new Panama/FFI/FFM API. Thus, no JNI is required and the library is platform independent as long a matching memory
template is provided.

Please note, that this project is work in progress and only a few PKCS11 functions are implemented at the moment

## Tested platform and devices

This library was tested with a SafeNet eToken 5110 on the following platforms:

* Windows 11 x64
* Linux x64

Support for 32-bit platforms is not planned.

## Thanks

This library was heavily influenced by documentation and design of these projects:

* IAIK from TU Graz: https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/
* Pkcs11Interop from Jaroslav Imrich: https://pkcs11interop.net/
